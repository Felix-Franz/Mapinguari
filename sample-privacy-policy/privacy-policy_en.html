With this page we would like to explain you in an understandable way and without legal jargon, how we collect, process and store your data.
If anything is unclear to you, or you have suggestions for improvement, please contact us. You can find our contact details in the imprint. We are looking forward to your message!

<h2>Personalization</h2>
To personalize the game we ask for your name when you join a room and ask you to create an avatar.
Of course, you can use a nickname here, and the avatar must look similar to yours.
We also process the decisions you make during the game (e.g. which card you reveal).
All this data will be deleted from our server at the latest when the last player has left the room.
<br />
However, we save your current language as well as your name and avatar locally on your device.
You can delete all local data at any time using the button below.

<h2>jitsi meeting</h2>
The game lives on the interaction between the participants.
Therefore, we have integrated <a href="https://jitsi.org/" target="_blank">jitsi</a> into our game, making it possible in the app to conduct a video conference.
Only when the game master activates the meeting in the lobby, data is exchanged with the instance <code>meet.jit.si</code> and you can join the call.
The jitsi server is only used to connect to the other participants of the meeting, the meeting itself runs over WebRTC.
The corresponding privacy policy applies.

<h2>Logs</h2>
For troubleshooting purposes, we create logs that can include IP addresses, among other things.
We keep the logs confidential, of course, and use them only for troubleshooting.
Also, we only store the last 1500 log entries and delete each entry after one week.

<h2>External services we use</h2>.
To provide the game we use <a href="https://heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> for hosting, <a href="https://cloudflare.com" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a> for DNS, DDoS protection and analytics, and <a href="https://forwardemail.net/" target="_blank">Forward Email</a> to forward your mail from the address given in the imprint.
These services process your data (such as IP address) according to their privacy policy.

<h2>Tracking</h2>
We use tracking from <a href="https://cloudflare.com" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a> to get infomation about the usage of the game.

<h2>Ads</h2>
