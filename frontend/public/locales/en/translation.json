It hits, breaks, and envelops Mapinguari in a purple mist. For a few seconds nothing happens. But when the silence is almost unbearable, a huge yawn resounds across the clearing. The purple mist dissipates and you see Mapinguari rubbing his eye tiredly. Slowly he trots back into the jungle to find a cave for his nap. Until someone dares to wake him again. You have done it.

A gigantic beast with long claws, shaggy fur and a huge mouth that covers its entire belly. His one big eye looks at you angrily. Immediately you begin to shoot at this monstrous monster, but bullets do not seem to harm him, so you take flight.\n\nAn elder of the Cario Indians later tells you that Mapinguari can not be killed, but there is a potion that is able to put the beast back to sleep. However, this potion only works until the 4th night after Mapinguari's awakening.\n\nYou know you have to find the necessary ingredients before it's too late and Mapinguari is unstoppable.\n\nBut there are many tracks in the jungle and not all of them lead to the hoped-for ingredients. Besides, not all of you think that the Mapinguai should be put back to sleep."
